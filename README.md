#Fibonacci

Language: MASM

This is a assembly language program that creates a fibonacci sequence and stores the sequence in array indexes.
The program uses 47 as the number of elements in the array thus the first 47 numbers in the fibonacci sequence.

Design: 
A single loop is used to increment, exchange, and decrement the values in the sequence.
